Run the IrrigationDuration.ipynb after the installation of all the required libraries.
At the bottom of the last cell a link is generated which is to be pasted onto any web browser.
Then sign up (if you are a new user) or sign in(if you are a existing user).
You will be redirected to a dashboard which displays soil moisture content, Precipitation probability, Precipitation and Crop status(0 -> Droop plant 1-> Healthy plant)
And the irrigation duration will be computed and displayed.
